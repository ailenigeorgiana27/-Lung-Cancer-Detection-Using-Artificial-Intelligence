# 🧠 Lung Cancer Detection Using Artificial Intelligence

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to develop an **intelligent system** that assists doctors in the **early diagnosis of lung cancer**, which is known as the deadliest form of cancer worldwide.

---

## 💡 Motivation

Although lung cancer has a high mortality rate, **early detection** significantly increases the chances of successful treatment and patient survival. The burden on medical professionals can be reduced with the help of **AI-based solutions** that automate disease detection and classification.

This project aims to build an AI-driven system capable of analyzing medical images and identifying early signs of lung cancer using advanced deep learning techniques, such as **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**. The system would:

- Detect lung cancer at early stages when treatments are more effective.
- Support clinical decision-making by providing accurate diagnostic insights.
- Reduce the time needed for diagnosis and minimize human error.
- Help tailor treatments based on tumor and patient-specific features.

## 📌 Project Scope & To-Do List

### ✅ 1. Problem Definition
- **Input**: Medical imaging data (e.g., chest X-rays or CT scans)
- **Output**: Binary or multi-class prediction (e.g., "cancer detected" / "no cancer")
- **Why AI?**: Manual interpretation is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires expert knowledge. AI models can learn complex patterns from large datasets and deliver high diagnostic accuracy consistently.

---

### ✅ 2. Input Data Analysis
- **Data Type**: Medical images (potentially labeled)
- **Dataset Size**: To be determined (sample size analyzed during exploration)
- **Data Distribution**: Class balance/imbalance, presence of noise, image resolution, etc.

---

### ✅ 3. Software Mini-Application
- Basic notebook script that:
  - Accepts image input in a specified format
  - Outputs a mock classification result (hardcoded for testing)
  - Is ready for model integration

---

### ✅ 4. AI Model Development
- **Model Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Training Setup**:
  - Split: Training / Validation / Testing
  - Hyperparameters: Learning rate, batch size, optimizer, number of epochs, etc.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC

---

### 🧪 5. Evaluation and Improvements
- Evaluate model performance on unseen data
- Identify overfitting/underfitting risks
- Propose improvements:
  - Data augmentation
  - Transfer learning with pretrained models
  - Hyperparameter tuning
  - Ensemble learning techniques
